***********8remember let a be string then a+a contai all rotations of string a

string str = "geeksforgeeks a computer science"; 
    string str1 = "geeks"; 
  
    // Find first occurrence of "geeks" 
    size_t found = str.find(str1); 
    if (found != string::npos) 
        cout << "First occurrence is " << found << endl; 
 
The function returns the index of the first occurrence of sub-string, if the sub-string is not found it returns string::npos(string::pos is static member with value
das the highest possible for the size_t data structure).
string::npos------It means not found.

It is usually defined like so:

static const size_t npos = -1;
***a.find(b);
