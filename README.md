## Overview

The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of algorithms/ Standard problems implemented in C++. Hence, I tried to implementate the codes of same pattern or standard problem with the standard & efficient approach.

## Features

* The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).
* Each source code is atomic using [STL classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library).
